# autoclicker
I don't want to do the same click over and over again, so yeah...

I programmed this for stage farming in Arknights, you can adjust the click position and delay if you use this for other purposes.

Run **click_locator.py** then place the cursor to your desired location.
### NOTE : Use this at your own risk.
